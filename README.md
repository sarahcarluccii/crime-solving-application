# crime-solving-application
Authors of Project: Sarah Carlucci, Austin Stipo, Connor Downey, Alex Santoro
This repository includes a group project that I contributed to during my sopohmore year Spring semester. 
This was completed in my Software Engineering class. 
The objective of the project was to create an application that helps police solve crimes. 
We spent the majority of the semester working through the various steps of the software development life cycle in order to complete the project.
